# AFIB


Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm characterised by rapid and irregular beating of the atria. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time.

Our Android app takes in the user health statistics like Spectral Entropy,Heart rate, turning point ratio, etc. Based on the inputs of the user, the data is compared with the static data stored in the SQLite and shows if the corresponding user is suffering from the same. The underlying data for comparison was taken from a CSV file containing all the patient data.
